title: üè´ Workshops
---

The workshop concept is still being fleshed out.

I intend to have a wide range of mead types available,
including:
- most of the quart-size types from the [videos](videos) page,
- _gallon_ batches of the same ones but done with _modern equipment_, and
- gallon batches of mead types using things _not_ available at grocery stores.

Each student will
receive a full set of sanitized equipment and ingredients
(and a lecture describing this type of mead),
mix up the must,
pitch the yeast,
and generally make it all ready to start fermenting.<!--&nbsp;
Anything after the workshop,
including getting it all safely home,
putting it in a good place to ferment,
adding anything after fermentation,
removal of ingredients,
racking, stabilizing, bottling, etc.,
will be the students' responsibility.&nbsp;
However, they will be able to
contact me
with questions, suggestions, complaints, etc.-->

Equipment for the _quart_ sizes consists of:
- a US-quart (32 fluid ounce) mason jar,
- a lid and ring for the jar,
- a square of cheesecloth or similar cloth to fit over the jar's mouth,
- and a rubber band to hold the square of cloth in place.

For the _gallon_ sizes, it means:
- a US-gallon (128 fluid ounce) carboy, usually jug-type, maybe widemouth if we're adding large flavorings;
- for jug-type carboys,
  a drilled bung,
  a rubber band (to help keep the bung in place),
  and a carboy brush;
- for widemouth carboys, a drilled-and-grommeted lid;
- an airlock;
- an autosiphon;
- a turkey-baster;
- maybe bags if we're adding anything solid;
- and a hydrometer, sampling tube, and tube-brush.

"Ingredients" means:
- the honey,
- a packet of yeast (which will be _bread_ yeast for the "simple" ones),
- whatever liquid we're using (usually spring water, maybe fruit juice),
- and whatever else we're adding for flavoring.

Pricing is uncertain at this time,
as it would depend on
mead type,
batch size,
number of attendees,
and what deals I can find on
equipment,
ingredients,
and _a place to do it_.&nbsp;
So if you can host it,
get a big group together,
and/or supply equipment and/or ingredients,
that will lower the price!&nbsp;
At a wild guesstimate,
it will probably be on the order of
$30 a head for the quarts,
and
somewhere around
double to triple that
for the gallon batches,
all-inclusive,
for a dozen students,
making some unreliable assumptions.

The "service area" I intend is
roughly within an hour's drive of
[Fairfax, Virginia](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Fairfax,+VA/){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}.&nbsp;
I am willing to travel further to do this,
for expenses and extra fees,
and maybe even do it remotely.
