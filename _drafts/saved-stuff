- A larger jug/bottle type carboy, or a _widemouth_ carboy,
usually five gallons,
sometimes larger.&nbsp;
These are usually in glass but also often in plastic,
because of weight.&nbsp;
European-style teardrop-shaped "demijohns" are often larger,
often around the twelve to fourteen gallon range,
and contained in a wicker basket for some padding and strength.&nbsp;
You'll need some kind of closure to hold your airlock;
with jug-types, it's usually a (larger) bung,
and with widemouths, it's usually a grommeted lid.&nbsp;
Some, such as a Fermonster, have a wide mouth,
which takes a screw-on lid,
which in turn has a hole in it for a bung.&nbsp;

and fancier things like conical fermenters.)

Why a bucket *and* a carboy, you may wonder? Buckets are great for the initial
fermentation ("primary"), especially if that gets vigorous. But they're not so
great for the stage after that, mostly about sweetening and other flavoring
("secondary") because they tend not to seal very well, so oxygen gets in (and
perhaps microbes too). That's not a concern in primary because the CO2 being
produced, creates positive pressure. For the same reasons, you might want a
good amount of "headspace" (space above your mead) in primary, but you don't
want much in secondary, because it will contain oxygen (unless you do something
about it). That said, you might want a good-sealing bucket for secondary *if*
you're adding something big like fruit or other solids for flavoring.

At the start this tells you how much
sugar you have in it,
which tells you how much alcohol you _can_ make from it.&nbsp;
At the end, it tells you how much sugar you have _left_ in it.&nbsp;
The difference tells you how much alcohol you _did_ make.&nbsp;
(At some point I might cover all that in a blog post or a video.)&nbsp;

and you want something you'll probably be able to use for other purposes,
or at the very least not spend much money on.&nbsp;
If you're on a _very_ tight budget
you could even go a pinch smaller and use a spaghetti sauce jar,
which is typically 28 ounces &mdash;
just make sure it's glass, not plastic.&nbsp;
