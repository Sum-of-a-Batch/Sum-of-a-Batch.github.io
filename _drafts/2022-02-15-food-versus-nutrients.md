title: Food versus Nutrients (versus Friends?)
---

Recently someone said in
[the Facebook Mead group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2204648847/){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}
"Raisins have sugar and starch,
the two basic needs of yeast to ferment in mead.&nbsp;
So how are they not[ nutrients]?"

I wrote a fairly long response,
and these days that means...&nbsp;
_blog fodder!_&nbsp;;-)&nbsp;
So here's a slight adaptation of what I said:

There is a vast difference between "something to ferment" and "nutrients".&nbsp;

In our case, "something to ferment" is mainly honey.&nbsp;
Yes, it can be supplemented a bit with raisins &mdash;
or any other fruit, or other source of sugar.&nbsp;

"Nutrients", however,
are additional things that help the fermentation
go smoothly and reasonably quickly,
versus producing off-flavors or going too slowly.&nbsp;
You can think of them like vitamin supplements.&nbsp;

The problem is that honey contains
almost nothing but water and assorted sugars.&nbsp;
(This is all the more true if it's been filtered.&nbsp;
Back in Ye Olde Dayes when they just
chucked the whole skep-hive into the cauldron and boiled it,
they at least got some extra nutrients from
the hive itself, wax, larvae, pollen, bees, etc.)&nbsp;
So, feeding your yeast nothing but honey is like
a person living on sugar.&nbsp;
Not even mixing in some brown sugar,
along with the pure overprocessed bleached white sugar,
will give a person proper nutrition to stay healthy.&nbsp;

Now, if you're doing a very light ferment,
like if you're making Sima with only one pound of honey in each gallon,
and only letting it get halfway done fermenting,
okay, you can get away with it.&nbsp;
Or if you're just playing around and
don't really mind that you're not making the best mead you could, okay.&nbsp;
But if you want to take a simple step that could
make your mead much better and more consistent,
use nutrients.&nbsp;
(And energizer, but that's a story for another day.)
