Welcome to _Sum of a Batch!_&nbsp;
This site is about making
[mead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mead){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"},
a wine-like drink
made by fermenting honey rather than fruit.&nbsp;
Most people
(at least Americans)
associate it with the Vikings --
but actually,
it was around for about 8,000 years before them!&nbsp;
It was made _everywhere_ that people had honey --
all over not only Europe,
but also Africa and Asia
(including at least the Philippines),
and even Central America!

### IMPORTANT NOTE:

**I do not _sell alcohol_.**&nbsp;
Nor do I give it away, as part of this business.&nbsp;
Not one drop, no way no how,
in any manner that could possibly be construed as selling,
or even risking giving any to a minor.&nbsp;
The laws on selling alcohol are just too complex and expensive
for me to bother even _trying_ to comply with,
and the penalties aren't worth the likely profits.&nbsp;
(And distilling is Right Out.)

What I _am_ giving away here on this website,
is the _knowledge_
for _you_ to _make your own_.&nbsp;
What I am selling in the workshops
is that knowledge plus the _equipment and ingredients_,
which consists mostly of things that anybody could easily buy
at their local grocery store.

Any responsibility for:
- the transfer of _your_ alcohol to any other party;
- what _you_ or any other party do after drinking;
- _your_ possession, drinking, or making of alcohol
at your age and in your jurisdiction;
- and any other consequences of following the advice herein;

is _entirely on you_.
