Welcome to _Sum of a Batch!_&nbsp;
This site is about making
[mead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mead){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"},
a wine-like drink
made by fermenting honey rather than fruit.&nbsp;
Most people
(at least Americans)
associate it with the Vikings,
but actually,
it was around for about 8,000 years before them,
and was made _everywhere_ that people had honey,
all over not only Europe,
but also Africa and Asia,
including the Philippines,
and even Central America!
