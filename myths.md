### 1: The Vikings Invented Mead

This one has about as much truth to it as that the Vikings
wore horns on their battle helmets,
or many other Viking myths I could bust,
but this is a _mead_ website, not a _Viking_ website.

Mead is _much_ older,
and more geographically widespread,
than the Vikings.&nbsp;
The earliest _evidence_ of mead production
is from about 9,000 years ago
(so it's likely much older than that),
and comes from northeastern _China!_&nbsp;
It was also a part of the ancient cultures of
India, Nepal, Egypt,
North _and_ South Africa
(the middle, I'm not so sure of),
Greece, most of the _rest_ of Europe,
many islands of the Philippines,
and even upper _Central America_ &mdash;
basically everywhere that there was some sort of native honeybee,
productive enough that humans could harvest the honey.&nbsp;
By contrast, the "Viking Age" is generally considered to be
about 793 to 1066,
not only rather brief and fairly localized,
but also relative _latecomers_ to mead.

### 2: All Mead is the Same

You just read above about how long ago mead was invented,
and how widespread it has been.&nbsp;
As you might expect, this led to there being many different ways to make it,
with it turning out very differently.&nbsp;
Just some examples of differences:

- Different ratios of honey
(pounds per gallon)
will make it _potentially_ stronger and/or sweeter.&nbsp;
(The exact mix depends on what yeast you use.)

- Different honeys will make it taste different.

- Most mead is still.&nbsp;
But it _can_ be carbonated,
either in the bottle (or can),
or by forcing CO2 (or N2 or other gases) into it at serving time.&nbsp;

- Lots of different things can be added for flavoring,
or it can be left plain.&nbsp;
Common additions ("adjuncts") include
all kinds of fruits, herbs, spices,
and more modern things,
such as all kinds of hard candies
(e.g., peppermints, Fireballs, all the flavors of Jolly Ranchers, etc.).

### 3: More Specifically, Mead is Always Sweet

Think about it.&nbsp;
Grapes are sweet, right?&nbsp;
Is _wine_ always sweet?&nbsp;
No!&nbsp;
Same deal.&nbsp;
It all depends how much sugar is _left over after_
the yeast have eaten their fill.&nbsp;
Mead can be anywhere from cloyingly sweet to bone-dry.

So why is
the vast majority of
commercial mead from the big makers,
so sweet?&nbsp;
It's a viscous circle.&nbsp;
(And yes, a vicious one too.)&nbsp;
Most people think mead is sweet,
and the big commercial mead-makers
are happy to cater to that misconception.&nbsp;
Worse yet, the
Renaissance Festivals
(even less historically accurate than Viking helmet horns),
Medieval Times,
and other such tourist-traps,
serve up cheap mead,
which is of course the too-sweet stuff from the big commercial makers!&nbsp;
Or even more worser-er yet,
sometimes it's "meade" or some other mispelynge &mdash;
which usually isn't really mead at all,
but cheap white wine (often sweet to begin with) with honey added.&nbsp;
"Meade" is to "mead" as "cheez" is to "cheese".

### 4: Mead is Hard to Make

This website is mainly about making mead as easily as possible.&nbsp;
But, that doesn't mean that "the hard way" is hard!&nbsp;
It's a lot easier than beer &mdash;
no boiling needed!

In fact, mead is _so_ easy to make,
that one of the popular guesses
(nobody knows for sure)
about how mead was first made
doesn't even require humans to have _done_ anything!&nbsp;
_The_ most popular guess is that
some hunter-gatherer topped off a water-skin
with the honey from a hive he found,
but _my_ preferred guess is that
rain fell into a beehive
that had been built in
a hollow log (or some such thing),
that broke open.&nbsp;
Either of those ways
(and many more!)
would have diluted the honey enough that
it would have soon started fermenting,
due to wild yeast already in the honey,
or at the very least as soon as any wild yeast floated in.&nbsp;
But the second one _could_ have happened
_millions_ of times before humans even _existed_.

Don't believe me?&nbsp;

the easy way to make a small batch of mead,
using _only_ things you're practically guaranteed to find
at your local grocery store.
