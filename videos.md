The plan for the video series is to focus on 
"mead made simple",
in small quantities,
using only ingredients, supplies, and equipment,
that you can find at your local grocery store.&nbsp;
This way, you can try making mead,
without investing a lot of time, space, or money
on things
only obtainable
via mail-order or at a homebrew shop.&nbsp;
Some of you might not even _have_
a homebrew shop nearby,
or even
the practical ability to
receive things by mail order.

Episodes planned so far include:
- An introduction to the whole series
- Plain mead (usually mis-named "traditional"), probably with orange blossom
- Plain mead with a different _kind_ of honey, probably buckwheat
- Plain mead with a little _less_ honey
- Plain mead with a little _more_ honey (maybe at the same time as less?)
- Plain mead with more honey than _that_, by step-feeding
- _Spiced_ mead ("methglyn"), probably clover honey with cinnamon in secondary
- Using _apple juice_ instead of water ("cyser")
- Spicing _that_ to make "apple pie mead"
- Using _grape_ juice ("pyment")
- Using actual _fruit_ instead of juice ("melomel"), probably blackberries
- Adding more fruit _after_ fermentation, probably blackberries again
- Sima
- With _maple syrup_ (acerglyn)
- With _coffee_ (coffeeamel)
- With _hot peppers_ (capsicumel/capsumel) -- possibly trying sliced jalapenos, crushed red pepper, and other ways
- Using _tea_ for tannins
- _Making_ a tea of herbs or spices, to flavor mead _indirectly_
- Fermenting _without_ deliberately adding yeast ("wild ferment")
- _Maybe_ mead with partly _caramelized_ honey ("bochet")
- Feel free to suggest more!

Most episodes will actually be split into multiple videos,
trying to keep them under about five minutes each
(for modern short attention spans):
- Just showing _how it's done_
- What a _modern hobbyist_ would do differently
- What a person in _"olde tymes"_ would have done differently
- Any relevant _history_ and/or _theory_
- Added later, relevant _Q&A_, if you send relevant questions

And there may be also some _general_ Q&A videos.
