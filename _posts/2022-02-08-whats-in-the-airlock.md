title: What's in Your Wallet, er, I mean, Airlock?
---

Another common beginner question is:
"That doesn't look like water in your airlock, what is it?"

This is because most people start off putting water in their airlocks.&nbsp;
That's a perfectly reasonable choice &mdash;
but not the only one.&nbsp;
Even with this approach, there's the question of
what _kind_ of water.&nbsp;
So, the main choices of airlock liquid are:

- **The same water you made your must with**.&nbsp;
Probably easily available and cheap.&nbsp;
But, it probably won't do much to prevent
bacteria, mold, or even some kinds of insects from getting through.&nbsp;
In fact, if you used spring water, well water, mineral water,
or any other water with much micronutrients in it,
it will probably _help_ microbes grow.

- **_Tap_ water**.&nbsp;
You probably didn't use this to make your mead,
as it is generally advised against.&nbsp;
(Maybe I'll cover that in a later post.)&nbsp;
The chlorine in it
(in most cities of most advanced countries, anyway)
should help with the microbes . . .
but by the same token, if it gets into your must,
it could somewhat inhibit the yeast from working.&nbsp;
(How would it get into your must, you ask?&nbsp;
Long story short, if the ambient air pressure rises enough,
a three-piece airlock would pull some in.&nbsp;
This is one advantage of an S-type airlock.)

- **Sanitizer fluid**.&nbsp;
While things such as Star-San are _supposed_ to be
odorless, colorless, tasteless, and
perfectly harmless to humans,
I just _don't like_ the idea of it possibly winding up in my mead.&nbsp;
Plus, it would inhibit the yeast more than tap water.&nbsp;
Many of them work by being too acidic for microbes,
so it would further lower (acidify) the pH of your must.

- **Vodka** (or other strong spirits).&nbsp;
Now we're talking!&nbsp;
Anti-microbial, hostile to insects too,
and if it gets into your must,
it's just water and alcohol, which are there already.&nbsp;
Just be careful when using spirits with any distinctive flavor.

So what I suggest is
the cheapest vodka you can find,
from a reputable source
(not Uncle Bubba's 'shine still!),
in reasonable volume &mdash;
for whatever definition of "reasonable volume"
fits your needs and budget.&nbsp;
If you're just starting out,
and not sure you want to continue making mead,
maybe a half-pint hip-flask;
once you're doing a new five-gallon batch every week,
it might be a gallon.
