title: What Makes It Mead?
---

Someone recently asked on
[the Facebook Mead group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2204648847){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"},
if anybody had ever used
half honey and half high sugar apple juice
to make mead.

The main answer was that
such a mix would yield too high a starting gravity
to ferment well.&nbsp;
That seemed to me to be
[ass-u-me](https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1339:_When_You_Assume){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}-ing
that the halves were by volume
(though I think halves by weight would yield similar results).

But it got me thinking...
what if it were halves by "sugar contribution",
so that half the fermentable sugars
were from the honey
and the other half
were from the apple juice?

One problem in the mead world is that
there is no universal definition of mead,
except that it contains
at least some significant amount of
alcohol derived from fermenting honey.&nbsp;
Some _legal jurisdictions_ have their own definitions,
usually for _tax_ purposes,
but of course they differ,
and are generally made by
bureaucrats with no clue what they're talking about.&nbsp;
This often results in the definitions seeming a bit arbitrary &mdash;
51% is fairly common,
so something at, say, 50.9% is not mead,
which I find ridiculous.&nbsp;
(Did their math education never extend beyond "whole numbers"?)&nbsp;
Mead _competitions_ also have their own definitions,
not only for "what is mead"
but usually many _categories_ as well,
though that's beyond the scope of this blog post.

Exact halves by sugar-contribution would be
on the borderline of most people's definitions of "mead",
so some folks would deny that it's truly mead.&nbsp;
I generally go by the definition
that _most_ of the fermented sugars
(half plus one molecule)
have to be from honey,
in order to _definitely_ call it mead.&nbsp;
So, if I were making this mix,
I might hesitate to call it mead.&nbsp;
However, many others say "at least half".&nbsp;
So if _you_ want to call it mead,
go right ahead,
but you could also call it wine,
and that gets into a gray area of "what is this thing, really?".&nbsp;
I don't care about it enough to argue,
other than for the sake of meta-arguing about the definition.&nbsp;
;-)

Just for the sake of completeness:
I've also heard some people say it's mead if
the honey-derived alcohol is a _plurality_
(more than from any other ingredient),
or _at least_ as much as any other ingredient.&nbsp;
I could agree with that _if_
"other ingredient" is broadened to
"other *category* of ingredient".&nbsp;
So, frex, if the sugars are
30% from grapes,
30% from pears,
and 40% from honey,
I'd say it's a
_multi-fruit wine_ with honey _also_ fermented in it.&nbsp;
But if those are the proportions and it's from
grapes, _some kind of grain_, and honey,
okay, I won't object to calling it mead.&nbsp;
And if it's exactly 1/3 of each,
we're back to
"it's on the borderline,
call it wine, beer, mead, whatever,
I don't care enough to argue."
