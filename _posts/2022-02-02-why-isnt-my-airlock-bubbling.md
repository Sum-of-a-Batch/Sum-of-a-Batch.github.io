title: Why Isn't My Airlock Bubbling?
---

One frequently asked question is,
"I've definitely got fermenting going on;
I can see the bubbles rising inside the carboy.&nbsp;
So why isn't my airlock bubbling?"

Most likely, you've got an _air leak_.&nbsp;
So long as you've still got fermentation happening,
this isn't much of a problem.&nbsp;
The CO2 being produced
should provide enough positive pressure
that you don't have to worry about
oxygen or mold or bacteria
getting in.&nbsp;
But, if you're going to use the same equipment for
so-called "_secondary_"
(where there's usually little to no fermentation going on),
make sure it's sealed better then.

Even _with_ active fermentation, though,
you might want your equipment sealed better,
so that _when that stops_ you're not running that risk.&nbsp;
It will also enable the airlock to give you some clue
how active the fermentation is.&nbsp;
(Caveat: airlock bubbles do not always mean fermentation,
and lack does not mean lack.&nbsp;
Bubbles could be from off-gassing,
and _apparent_ lack could be from it just
bubbling too slowly for you to notice.)

So how do you seal your container better?&nbsp;
It depends what kind of container you've got.

Buckets are great for primary,
for reasons I _might_ cover later.&nbsp;
But most of them don't seal very well.&nbsp;
For snap-on lids,
this can often be solved with
a gasket inside the lid, where the rim of the bucket fits in.&nbsp;
If you can't find suitable ready-made gaskets,
you can make one by twisting up some plastic-wrap.&nbsp;
You could also try putting duct tape
around the lid,
securing it better to the bucket.&nbsp;
(Yes, this makes it more of a PITA to get the lid off and back on.)&nbsp;
For screw-on (such as Gamma) lids,
I don't know, but taking a wild guess,
maybe some teflon tape on the screw threads might help,
just like with plumbing.&nbsp;
If it's a _very_ loose fit,
maybe something thicker,
like masking tape.

But what about jug-type carboys,
like most of us use for one-gallon batches?&nbsp;
If your carboy has a handle or two,
you can use a rubber band
to apply a bit of downward pressure on the bung,
as in this picture:

![bung secured in carboy with rubber band](/assets/img/bung-secured-w-rubber-band.jpg)
{:class="center"}

(The rubber band forms an X
between the airlock stem
and the edge of the bung
opposite the handle.&nbsp;
If your carboy has _two_ handles,
you'll find it much easier to arrange it
in a way that will balance the forces
so it doesn't tilt the airlock.)

This should give you enough
downward pressure on the bung
to keep it airtight in the neck &mdash;
but not _so_ securely that
it would increase the risk of bottle bombs
(in the event that your must clogs the airlock for whatever reason).

But what if your jug doesn't _have_ handles,
as is fairly common on European "demijohns",
multi-gallon carboys,
and large-lidded carboys with bung-holes in them,
such as this Fermonster lid?

If there's any kind of _rim_,
such as below this Fermonster's lid,
you can tie a piece of string below _that_,
and attach your rubber band(s) there.&nbsp;
(Depending how much of a rim there is,
you may need to tie it very tightly,
but leave extra string to form a loop,
and attach them to _that_.)

If you're using a _large_ or _heavy_ carboy/demijohn,
you might have it in
a _harness_
or a _basket_.&nbsp;
If so, you can attach your rubber bands to _that_.&nbsp;
(Again, possibly with the aid of string.)

If you are using something with a _grommeted_ lid,
perhaps the lid and/or the grommet itself is leaking.

- The lid might not be sealing well
against the mouth of the jar.&nbsp;
Try a gasket,
either just inside the underside,
or in the form of a liner.&nbsp;
(A liner can also help with a leaky grommet with too big a gap.)

- The outer diameter of the grommet's body may be
too much smaller than the hole in the lid.&nbsp;
The easiest fix for this to get a larger grommet.&nbsp;
(But then you'll probably have one of the below problems.)&nbsp;
Or, you can get/make another lid,
with a smaller hole.&nbsp;
If your fine motor skills are excellent,
you can _try_ wrapping a thin strip of tape
around the grommet's body.

- The grommet's gap, between the upper and lower flaps,
may be too much larger than
the thickness of the lid.&nbsp;
You can fix this with some kind of shim,
just to take up space.&nbsp;
It would be easier, safer, and probably more effective,
to stick this under the upper flap,
_outside_ your fermenter,
rather than above the lower one,
_inside_.&nbsp;
But, if the whole _lid_ doesn't seal well either,
you might want to line that whole thing.

- The grommet's hole may be too big for your airlock's stem.&nbsp;
In this case, wrapping some tape
(cellophane, teflon, masking, whatever)
around the airlock stem can make it big enough to fit snugly.

There are probably a few more not leaping to my poor little brain.&nbsp;
Eventually I will install a comment system here and you can ask.

EDITED TO ADD:

So how do I tell if my bucket is leaking?&nbsp;
Push down very gently on the top,
and see if that gives you much airlock activity.&nbsp;
Before letting go, keep your pressure on it,
and see if the airlock rebalances itself.&nbsp;
If you don't get _any_ activity when you push,
it's leaking like a sieve!&nbsp;
If you only get a little, it _may_ still be leaky;
use your own judgement in comparing the airlock activity
to how much you would expect,
given how much you flexed the lid;
you could try pushing more.&nbsp;
If it rebalances itself with the pressure still on,
you've definitely got a leak.&nbsp;
If it doesn't, you probably don't, at least not a serious one.
