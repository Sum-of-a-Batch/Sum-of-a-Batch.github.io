Whoops, looks like I've been forgetting to blog here
for quite some time!&nbsp;
(I haven't mentioned the very popular spiced cyser,
another batch of Lehua trad,
the tangerine honey, cranberries, and OJ concentrate batch
that I dubbed Tan-Cran-Ora but a friend suggest Orancrantan,
nor a few other not-terribly-unusual batches.)&nbsp;
But that's actually relevant to
a mead-making "milestone" I've "achieved".

In early November, I started a batch of mead.&nbsp;
(One five-pound jug of wildflower honey from Wegman's,
a gallon and a quart of water,
and 71B yeast.&nbsp;
The intent was to let it ferment dry,
and backsweeten with some of
the meadowfoam honey my wife bought me.)&nbsp;

Then I went on a few trips,
and then came the holidays.&nbsp;
A few days into January,
I decided to try making cold-brew coffee.&nbsp;
So I dug out the little bags.&nbsp;
I had originally bought them
to hold spices for metheglyn,
so they were in one of my boxes of mead supplies,
next to where I stash my two three-gallon Fermonsters.

"Wait, that's odd, I could swear I have two,
why is there only one there?!"

Yup, I had achieved the milestone of
completely forgetting about a batch I had started!&nbsp;
Even sillier, I had been doing things with
another batch I had continued in the meantime!&nbsp;
At least it was only about two months,
not years, like many cases I've heard of.&nbsp;
It was in a cabinet under a kitchen counter,
where I almost never go unless I'm dealing with a batch of mead.&nbsp;
(The other batch was elsewhere.)

The airlock had indeed run dry,
but it smelled normal.&nbsp;
There were some suspicious-looking dark particles in the lees,
but I think that was just settled-out Bentonite,
since for primary I don't generally make a slurry
but dump it right in.&nbsp;
It's now cold-crashing in the two-gallon bucket
that I should have used in the first place,
at SG 0.996 according to the Tilt.
