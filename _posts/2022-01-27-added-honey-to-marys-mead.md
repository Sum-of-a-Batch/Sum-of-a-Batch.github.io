title: Using Bread Yeast
---

Recently someone on a forum asked about using bread yeast.&nbsp;
Since that's such a common question,
I decided to record my answer here.

`===8<---cut-here-for-answer---`

Generally speaking, you want the yeasts
intended for wine, beer, or cider,
or the occasional rare variety intended for mead,
not for bread.&nbsp;
These have been bred (no pun intended)
to have a particular level of alcohol tolerance
(though that is only a rough guide),
temperature tolerance,
production of esters,
and other characteristics often important in brewing.&nbsp;
Bread yeast has mainly been bred to have a given level of CO2 production,
as that's what makes bread rise.&nbsp;
To us, that's just a byproduct,
usually to be gotten rid of
(unless we're trying to make it sparkling).

That said, it's certainly possible to make a decent mead with bread yeast, and there are recipes that call for it -- but you'll get a much more consistent, and usually better, mead with yeasts intended for brewing.
