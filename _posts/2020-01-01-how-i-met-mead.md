title: How I Met Your Mother, er, I mean, Mead
---

I think I first heard of mead when reading
[Beowulf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beowulf){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}
in Brit-Lit (British Literature) class in high school in about 1979.&nbsp;
(Yes, it's technically British, though it's about Danes.&nbsp;
Remember, it was written in 
[Old English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}.)&nbsp;
To the best of my recollection, though,
I never actually _had_ mead until sometime around fifteen years later,
when my best friend's girlfriend
(no, she didn't 
[used to be mine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkSmLh2Hbi0){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"})
brought some to
[Pennsic](http://www.pennsicwar.org/){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"},
the big annual East-coast USA shindig of the SCA
([Society for Creative Anachronism](https://www.sca.org/){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}).

In the early 2010's, my wife bought me some mead kits,
which I made and enjoyed.&nbsp;
So that was my first time _making_ mead,
though I was still pretty clueless about
_why_ I was doing each step,
what could be done _differently_,
and _why_ one might.

A few years later, we were in
[Colchester, Vermont](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Colchester,+VT){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"},
looking for dinner near our hotel,
and
[Yelp](https://yelp.com/){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}
suggested
[Colchester Mead Hall](http://www.colchestersmeadhall.com/menu.html){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}.&nbsp;
There wasn't much else close by,
they had some food that sounded good,
I was curious about mead,
and . . . they did flights!&nbsp;
So that was my first taste of _commercial_ meads.&nbsp;
(Since then I've had flights at various other meaderies,
such as
[Silver Hand](https://www.silverhandmeadery.com/){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}
fairly close to home in
[Williamsburg, Virginia](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Williamsburg,+VA){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"},
and
[Nani Moon](https://nanimoonmead.com/){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}
much further away,
[Kapa'a, Hawai'i](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kapa%CA%BBa,+HI){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"},
on
[Kauai](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kauai){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}.)

Fast forward to 2020.&nbsp;
The COVID pandemic had started to take hold.&nbsp;
There was lockdown.&nbsp;
Stores were running very low on the usuals:
milk, toilet paper, and _bread_.&nbsp;
People were starting to bake their _own_ bread.&nbsp;
Pretty soon, stores were starting to run low on _baking yeast_.&nbsp;
My wife has a friend who bakes a lot . . .
and who offered to share out her stash of yeast.

That got me wondering . . . _can_ you make beer, wine, etc.,
with _bread_ yeast?&nbsp;
I researched, and found a recipe for
Joe's Ancient Orange Mead, aka JAOM.&nbsp;
(Not linked here because it's a careful balance of _bad habits_
that you shouldn't get started on.&nbsp;
Lots of people also try to modify it,
that doesn't work out well,
and they get discouraged and quit mead.)&nbsp;
For the second kit,
I had gone to my LHBS
(which _really is_ called
[My Local HomeBrew Shop](https://mylhbs.com/){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"})
and gotten "real equipment",
i.e., an actual carboy, plus caps with and without holes, and an airlock,
so I was well equipped to just go ahead and make it,
so I did!

It turned out pretty good . . . but much sweeter than I liked.&nbsp;
By that time I had started hanging around in
[the Facebook "Mead" group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2204648847/){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"},
where BTW I am now dubbed a "Group Expert".&nbsp;
(Guess that doesn't take much beyond running off at the keyboard!)&nbsp;
I gained a basic understanding of the process,
and realized that I could use the half-packet of
[Mangrove Jack M05](https://mangrovejacks.com/products/mead-m05-yeast-10g){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"},
that I had left over from the second kit,
to chew through some of those sugars...
while still leaving _some_ behind.&nbsp;
That brought it down from a much-too-sweet 1.04something
to a much nicer 1.02something.&nbsp;
And of course the extra alcohol was a nice bonus!

Now I was thoroughly hooked on mead.&nbsp;
I found a number of other resources
(see [Links](links)),
and my eyes were opened to the even wider world of mead.&nbsp;
I've since made several more batches
(including some JAOM variants, _some_ of which turned out okay),
planned many more,
and learned enough that I feel compelled to share it with the world.&nbsp;
It's also something to keep me out of
_too_ much trouble
now that I'm semi-retired . . .
and just _might_ provide barely enough income for
[Codosaurus](https://www.codosaur.us/){:target="_new"}
to turn a profit,
to keep
[the IRS](https://www.irs.gov/){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}
happy with the shiny-tech-toy deductions I want to keep taking.&nbsp;
:-)
