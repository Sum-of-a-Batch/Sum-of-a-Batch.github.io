title: Starting Equipment

So you want to start making mead,
but you're worried about
how much you'll have to spend on
equipment and supplies.&nbsp;
Not to worry, it's pretty cheap,
or at least cheaper than a typical setup for beer or wine.

The first thing you need is something to _hold_ the batch.&nbsp;
Actually you'll probably need _two_,
so you can "rack" it from one to another.&nbsp;
(I'll probably explain that in another "basics" post later.)&nbsp;
Your three main choices are:

- A quart or larger Mason-type jar.&nbsp;
This is fine if you're not really sure if you want to make mead,
or you're on a very tight budget.&nbsp;
You can _start_ by just covering it with a piece of cloth,
held on with a rubber-band,
but if you get serious
(but still make such small batches)
you'll want a lid with a
grommeted hole for an airlock (see below).&nbsp;
Once you _know_ you want to make more mead once in a while,
you'll almost certainly want something larger.

- A one-gallon carboy, usually jug-style and made of glass.&nbsp;
This is typical for low-volume hobbyists like me.&nbsp;
If you're on a tight budget
you could reuse a jug from apple juice or wine.&nbsp;
If you really get into making mead,
these are also common in five-gallon and larger sizes.&nbsp;
To close it, you'll want a bung (rubber stopper) or cap,
with a hole for an airlock (see below).

- A brew-bucket, typically of about two gallon capacity.&nbsp;
This is also common for low-volume hobbyists,
but available in much larger sizes if you get serious.&nbsp;
Not just any bucket will do, mind you,
it must be of the right kind of plastic
to withstand the _alcohol_ and _acidity_ of mead.&nbsp;
To close it, you'll need a lid with a grommeted hole for your airlock.

- There are larger things, and fancier things,
but I don't generally recommend them
until you are ready to really _commit_.

Regardless of what you use to hold your mead,
you're going to need _multiple_ things,
so you can transfer it from one to the other.&nbsp;
(Why would you do that?&nbsp;
I'll probably cover that later.&nbsp;
Meanwhile, if you're curious, you can web-search
"rack off the lees".)&nbsp;
If you're starting with small jars, okay, just get two jars,
else I'd recommend one plastic bucket and one glass jug-type carboy.

So how do you _do_ that transfer?&nbsp;
With quart jars and such
it's not worth it
to do anything other than
"pour carefully".&nbsp;
With gallon-plus containers, though,
the best way is an
[autosiphon](https://learn.kegerator.com/auto-siphon/){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"},
but be sure to get one properly sized (in length and width)
for your containers.&nbsp;
It's very frustrating to find at the last minute
that you can't autosiphon your mead out of your jug
because your autosiphon is too wide to fit!&nbsp;
How long a siphon tube you want on that
depends on how you're going to do the transfers.&nbsp;
You may also want a
[bottling wand](https://www.mrbeer.com/blog/post/how-to-use-a-bottling-wand-and-what-are-the-benefits-of-using-one){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}
on the other end of the tubing;
that will also reduce the length of tube needed.&nbsp;
You can find an auto-siphon, bottling wand, and tubing,
all sold together as a kit,
maybe even assembled.

I've already mentioned airlocks; you'll need at least one.&nbsp;
There are several kinds,
most notably "S" and "three-piece".&nbsp;
The S type is much easier to read, is generally cheaper,
and makes more of a fun "bloop" noise.&nbsp;
;-)&nbsp;
The three-piecer, however, is easier to clean
(by taking it apart),
is usually shorter
(important if you're tight on space, vertically),
and can serve as an adaptor for a
[blow-off tube](https://beerandbrewing.com/when-to-use-a-blow-off-tube/){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"},
which is something I might cover in some later post.

One piece that many beginners regret doing without is a
[hydrometer](https://www.grainger.com/know-how/equipment-information/kh-product-guide-how-to-use-a-hydrometer){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}.&nbsp;
This tells you the
[Specific Gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_density){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}
of your mead
(or your must, your "mead to be").&nbsp;
I'll spare you for now why you care about that.&nbsp;
They're usually glass so they're a bit fragile,
so buy two, or a plastic one.&nbsp;
You'll also need a sample tube,
which is rather like the graduated cylinders
you used in chemistry or maybe physics class in school.&nbsp;
(They may even _be_ graduated,
but that's not necessary for this purpose.)&nbsp;
With a large enough batch of mead,
you _could_ drop the hydrometer right in,
but it could break and ruin your batch,
or it could be difficult to extract from a jug-type carboy.&nbsp;
And to get the sample _into_ the tube,
you may find a turkey-baster useful &mdash;
yes, like you probably already have,
though I'd recommend a dedicated one.

Before _any_ of this touches your mead/must, though,
it should be _sanitized_.&nbsp;
So you'll need some sanitizer concentrate,
such as Star-San,
and some decently large container
(like that two-gallon bucket I mentioned above!)
to mix it up in.&nbsp;
You _could_ use bleach instead,
but be sure to rinse _thoroughly_ to get rid of the taste.

If you're going to leave some sugar in it,
and make more at once than you can drink in a week or three,
you'll also need a way to _stabilize_ it.&nbsp;
This _can_ be done with heat,
but that's rather tricky,
so the usual way is with _chemicals_,
such as the combination of
[potassium metabisulfite](https://foodadditives.net/preservatives/potassium-metabisulfite/){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}
and
[potassium sorbate](https://www.grapeandgranary.com/winemaking/additives/stabilizer-sorbate.html){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}
(aka K-meta and K-sorb)
or similar chemicals.

There are some other things that are optional but recommended,
especially if you're going for gallons or larger:
- yeast nutrients (no, raisins do _not_ provide significant yeast nutrient)
- yeast _energizer_ (very similar but used to _start_ the yeast)
- pH buffering agents, and a pH meter or test strips
- "clearing" or "fining" agents, such as bentonite or SuperKleer

Of course, there is an endless variety of
things you _could_ go buy,
including books to detail it all.
