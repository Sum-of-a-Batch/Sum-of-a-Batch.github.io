PLANS:
- add "imperial" versions of US volume units
- output in largest volume unit actually used
- add _mass/weight_ units (kilos, grams, pounds, oz av, etc.) and calculate the volume
- add a list of _liquids_ (water, honey, wine, vodka, etc.), which will populate the sg and maybe abv field with an approximation
- add which liquid contributed what % of sugars, assuming all mass above SG 1 is sugars, maybe with a warning that if the honey (if any) is below 50% it's not mead
- add way to designate a row as _desired total_ volume, and another as what to adjust to "make it so"
